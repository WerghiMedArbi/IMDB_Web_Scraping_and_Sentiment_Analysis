<h1>Project</h1>
This is just a small project we worked on for university. 
feel free to use if you're interested.

<h3>Description:</h3>
For this project, we have recovered data from any specific product
available on Sci-Fi Movies from IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/).
we conducted a sentiment analysis and statistical analysis necessary to draw relevant conclusions.


<h3>steps:</h3>

1- Web scrapping from https://www.imdb.com/ based on Beautiful Soup(Pythonâ€™s open-source library)
and saving the data collected as an excel file.
2- Data Cleaning for the data collected
3- Applying an algorithm for analyzing feelings through comments obtainedfor a film.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

So, using Web Scraping, we are able to gather information from a website and use the text data for sentiment analysis.
The whole process is simple and easy. Web scraping and NLP have many applications. The vast amount of text data at our 
disposal is so large, that the potential is immense.
