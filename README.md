<h1>Project</h1>
This is just a small project we worked on for university. 
feel free to use if you're interested.

<h3>Description:</h3>
For this project, we have recovered data from Sci-Fi Movies from[ IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/).
we conducted a sentiment analysis and the statistical analysis necessary to draw relevant conclusions.
<h3>Two Models were used:</h3>
- <h5>MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES:</h5>
It provides an alternative to the "heavy" 
AI-based semantic analysis and drastically simplifies textual data classification.
It calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest 
probability as output.


- <h5>VADER:</h5>
It is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. It is available in the NLTK package and can be applied directly to unlabeled text data.




<h3>steps:</h3>

1- Web scrapping from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) using Beautiful Soup(Pythonâ€™s open-source library)
and saving the data collected as an excel file.


2- Data Visualisation and Data Cleaning 


3- Applying an algorithm for sentiment analysis through movie reviews. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

So, using Web Scraping, we are able to gather information from a website and use the text data for sentiment analysis.
The whole process is simple and easy. Web scraping and NLP have many applications. The vast amount of text data at our 
disposal is so large, that the potential is immense.
  
  
<h3>Feedback</h3>  
  
If there's any problem with the code please create an issue, we'd still
otherwise appreciate your feedback if you have any
